# Snake_Game_Ai

I am new to github and im kind of new to coding i have some solid foundation.
The snake game code is from GeeksforGeeks, i have altered the code to suit the Ai more.
I used Pytorch to code the Neural Network.
The weights are included with 5 hours of training.
There will be more weights uploaded though and thats it for my commitment.

Quick Intro:
nn.py is the neural network code, there are some bugs to it and i will NOT fix them.
The Main.py is what you need to start up (nothing else) which ever way you want to: Shell, IDE, etc..
Main.py also includes all communication to nn.py and the actual game itself.

I am sorry for any grammatical errors and all the bugs in this script
