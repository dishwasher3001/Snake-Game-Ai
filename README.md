# Snake_Game_Ai

I am new to github and im kind of new to coding i have some solid foundation.
I used the snake game code from GeeksforGeeks, i have altered the code to suit the Ai more.
I used Pytorch to code the Neural Network So you will need to Install that.
The weights are included with 5 hours of training.
